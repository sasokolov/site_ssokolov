I have been working as an IT engineer since 2003.

My other hobbies you may discover on my social pages:

  * <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sassokol" target="_blank">Facebook</a>
  * <a href="https://vk.com/gurudeep" target="_blank">VKontakte</a>

[This blog][1] is only about my work. 

I&#8217;m not a programmer, but I can write simple scripts on perl, bash or python for ease my routine.  
I am a DevOps.
