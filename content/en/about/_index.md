![Sergey Sokolov](/images/DSC_0111.jpg)

My name is Sergey. I have been working in IT since 2003.

You can learn about my other interests besides work on social media:

* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sassokol)
* [VKontakte](https://vk.com/gurudeep)

However, [this blog](/) is dedicated to my main hobby — work.

I am not a programmer. I mean, I can certainly create a quick script in Perl or Bash, but it wouldn't qualify as a full-fledged program. It's more for easing my own routine tasks. In extreme cases, when there are obvious errors, I can provide a patch for an existing program. But I can give recommendations to programmers on performance optimization and security. I know quite a lot of "good" examples of "how not to do things."

I am a system administrator. The person whose work is usually completely invisible, if, of course, they do it well. [Here](/services/) I tried to briefly describe what I do.

If anyone is interested in my work history, you can find it in my [resume](/documents/Соколов-Сергей-Александрович.pdf), but at the moment I am not looking for permanent office work.
The fastest way to contact me is to write on [Telegram](https://t.me/SergeySokolov) or [E-mail](mailto:mail@example.com)
